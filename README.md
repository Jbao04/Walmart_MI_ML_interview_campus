Tasks:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Come up with an interesting question based on your EDA.
3. Build 1 supervised or unsupervise ML model to address your question. You can build more than 1 model, but be careful of time management.
4. Write a short report. 
    Starting with your interesting question based on your EDA. Draw some conclusion from your model, and propose next step to further investigate. 
    You can use word, ppt or similar format. 
    If you are using Jupyter notebook, you can have this report at the beginning our your notebook as session 1. Code create visualization can be in this first session. All other code should be in the second session below the report.  

What to turn in:
1. Create a branch with this format: date_firstname_lastname. In my case, it will be 20200229_tian_su. Please use all lower case.
2. Commit your report and code. Please don't include the data set.
